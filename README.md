# Hamiltonian Cycle Game

## Overview
The Hamiltonian Cycle Game is an interactive puzzle game built with Pygame. The goal is to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a randomly generated graph. A Hamiltonian cycle is a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. This game is a fun way to introduce players to fundamental concepts in graph theory and computational thinking.

## Features
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Players can see the graph and interact with vertices to attempt forming a Hamiltonian cycle.
- **Dynamic Graph Generation**: Each game generates a new graph based on user-specified parameters.
- **Real-Time Validation**: The game checks in real time whether the path selected by the player is a valid Hamiltonian cycle.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- Pygame 2.0 or later

## Installation
To run the Hamiltonian Cycle Game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Install Pygame**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Install Pygame using pip:
     ```bash
